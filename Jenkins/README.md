# Jenkins Config Files

The files in the directory were copied from a working Jenkins installation. 

TODO: write a script that updates these automatically (possibly as part of a Jenkins job?). Such a script __MUST__ omit sensitive info, like the Keychain password and TestFlight tokens, however.

Maybe a listing of plugins (and versions?) will be added eventually, as well.
