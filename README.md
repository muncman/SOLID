# Better than Bacon?

## This app is meant to be a simple demo app for my *CI for iOS* presentation. 

It will be hooked up to Continuous Integration. It will get unit and functional tests, using various tools. It will also have anything else I can throw at it.

I plan to use different build targets for the various tools. For example, if I use both OCUnit and GHUnit, I may put them into separate targets. This means there will likely be duplication of test coverage. This is fine, as my goal is to show the tools being used in a CI environment.

I hope, too, that the organization of the files in the project will evolve and become more consistent and clean as part of this process. This means there may be times of high volatility in the repository.
