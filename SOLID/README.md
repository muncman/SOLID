# S.O.L.I.D. Principles

## This app is meant to be a simple demo app for my *CI for iOS* presentation. 

It will be hooked up to Continuous Integration. It will get unit and functional tests, using various tools. It will also have anything else I can throw at it.

I plan to use different build targets for the different tools. For example, if I use both OCUnit and GHUnit, I may put them into separate targets. This means there will likely be duplication of test coverage. This is fine, as my goal is to show the tools being used in a CI environment.

__Let it be known, far and wide, that no claim is made that the tests in this project are of any quality whatsoever.__
